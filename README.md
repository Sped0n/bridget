> [!NOTE]
> This repository is currently in **maintaince mode** for two reasons:
>
> 1. I want to keep this theme minimal.
> 2. My bandwith after work is limited.
>
> BUT, bug fixes will be addressed (including related issues and PRs), and they are the **number one priority** for this project.
>
> Please understand that feature request might **NOT** be addressed or may take a long time to be implemented.
>
> Anyway, forks are welcomed, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you can do with the theme.
