Bridget is a _minimal_ Hugo theme designed for photographers/visual artists.

The inspiration for this theme came from a video by <u>[Hyperlexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed)</u>, which can be found <u>[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt3A2lNN2aE)</u>. Initially, it was developed using no third-party dependencies. However, after website designer <u>[Tyler McRobert](https://tylermcrobert.com)</u> made the source code publicly available, I realized that I have invented many unnecessary wheels, and this project was modified to porting the original design to hugo while focusing on _performance_.

Once again, great shout out to <u>[Tyler McRobert](https://tylermcrobert.com)</u> for his inspiration to this project.
